# Neural Networks (NN)

## What is it?
**Neural Networks** are a set of algorithms that try to mimic the human brain. They are designed to recognize patterns in data.

## How does it work?
Neural Networks work by passing data from one layer to the next, similar to how neurons in our brain pass signals. Each node in the network takes in data, processes it, and passes it on. The network learns from data over time, improving its accuracy.

## Example
A well-known example of a Neural Network is Googleâ€™s search algorithm. It uses a Neural Network to understand and rank web pages based on your search query.

## How to use it?
You can use Python libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement Neural Networks. These libraries provide pre-built functions and classes to help you design and train your network.

## When to use it?
Use Neural Networks when you have a complex problem where the relationship between input and output is not straightforward or easily understandable. They are particularly useful for tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
