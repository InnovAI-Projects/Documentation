# Linear Regression (LR)

## What is it?
**Linear Regression** is a way for computers to predict something based on a relationship between two things.

## How does it work?
It works by creating a straight line (that's the "linear" part) that best fits the data. The computer then uses this line to make predictions.

## Example
Let's say we have data on house prices and the number of bedrooms each house has. Linear Regression can help us predict the price of a new house based on the number of bedrooms it has.

## How to use it?
You can use Python libraries like scikit-learn to easily implement Linear Regression.

## When to use it?
Use Linear Regression when there's a clear relationship between two things and you want to predict one based on the other.
